	<h1>Procedural Equirectangular Textures</h1>

	<h3>What is it?</h3>

	<p>There are many types of textures	depending on the way
	they are constructed, how they are used or what objects
	they are designed to be applied onto. This project combines
	two of them:
	<ul>
		<li class="normal"><b>Procedural textures</b> are generated by code,
	instead of being extracted from photographs, scanned
	from illustrations or drawn by hand.</li>
		<li class="normal"><b>Equirectangular textures</b> are distorted in such a way,
	that they can be applied onto spheres.</li>
	</ul></p>

	<p>Consider a texture with polka dots and straight lines.
	The left image shows such texture, which is perfect for
	flat surfaces. An equirectangular version is shown on the
	right &ndash; it features strange deformations of shapes.</p>

	<div class="figures">
		<span class="figure">Normal texture<br><img src="texture-normal.jpg"></span>
		<span class="figure">Equirectangular texture<br><img src="texture-equirectangular.jpg"></span>
	</div>
	
	<p>When mapped to a sphere, the normal alignment of texture
	shapes gets distorted near the poles, while the equirectangular
	texture creates good proportions of shapes and straight
	lines. The deformation of shapes has been undeformed by
	the curvature of the sphere surface. This is what this
	project does &ndash; it generates equirectangular textures.</p>

	</div>
	
	<h3>But wait, there is more</h3>

	<p>When textures are applied to low-poly spheres there is
	a noticeable zig-zag distortion of the texture shapes,
	especially near the poles. This happens for normal and
	equirectangular textures alike. This phenomena is not
	caused by the texture itself, but by the algorithm that
	maps the texture on a sphere. This project provides a
	fix for this by modifying the shader code of materials.
	Even after the fix, one could see sharp corners in the
	lines. These are just optical illusions, caused by the
	hard edges of a low-poly geometry.</p>

	</div>
	
	<p>As the number of faces decreases, the deformation of
	textures becomes disturbing. The following image shows
	the normal, the equirectangular and the fixed equirectangular
	textures on a dodecahedron.</p>

	<h3>What's the catch</h3>

	<p>Fixing the shader code of Three.js materials adds
	additional instructions as a patch. A better solution
	would be if equirectangular mapping is supported
	natively for all maps, not just the environment map.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately, there is another, bigger issue. Equirectangular
	maps are not compatible with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap">mipmaps</a>. If mipmaps are used, the result will have a thin
	pixel-wide seam along the edge of the texture. Currently
	the project avoids the seam by turning off mipmaps. As a
	side effect, this removes texture smoothing and makes
	texture noise more prominent.</p>

	<p>A possible solution might be to limit the mipmaps to
	only the first few levels, or to mask the seam with
	sufficiently picturesque texture. If anyone knows a
	performant way to resolve this issue, it will make the
	library more useful to the general community.</p>
